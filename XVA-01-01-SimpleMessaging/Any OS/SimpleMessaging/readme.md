#XVA-01-01 Simple Messaging

This very basic example shows you how to connect to XSockets from JavaScript and create a chat with ~10 lines of JavaScript.

XSockets has no dependency to jQurey so the only thing used in the sample is plain JavaScript and knockoutjs to make things easier.

Since the sample uses the built-in "Generic" controller in XSockets there is no server-side code in the sample.
The only C# code is the code in "Startup.cs" that makes sure that the XSockets server starts.
