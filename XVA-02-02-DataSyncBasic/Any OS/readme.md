##XVA-02-02 DataSync Basic

### Installed Nuget Packages

- XSockets
- XSockets.JsApi

### Description

Phil Leggetter, a respected authority in the world of rea-time development has divided real-time communication into 4 areas.

- Simple messages (as shown in XVA-01-01)
- Publish Subscribe (as shown in XVA-01.02)
- RPC/RMI (as shown in XVA-01-03)
- DataSync (this sample)

So this sample will show a really basic datasync. We will look at a more complex scenario later on.

Each user can edit a list. When ever the list changes all clients will be notified. So you can open up two (or more) browser windows, do some basic CRUD on the list and see the changes instantly in all clients.
