##XVA-05-02 CustomProtocol Basic

### Installed Nuget Packages

- XSockets
- XSockets.JsApi
- Knockoutjs

### Description

This simple (and a bit stupid) sample gives you a first look at the power you get from being able to talk cross-protcol.

The sample shows you how to talk between a browser, putty and a TcpClient.
So we will have the browser talking RFC6455 (websockets) while the other clients will use raw sockets to communicate over our "StupidProtocol"
