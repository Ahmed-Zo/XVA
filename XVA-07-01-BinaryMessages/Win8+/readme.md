### Installed Nuget Packages

- XSockets.Owin.Host
- XSockets.JsApi

### Description

XSockets supports binary messages and can even pass metadata along with binary messages. 

In this basic example you can see how a simpe file share in action. Choose one (or more) images or text-files and see how they are distributed to all clients. 

You will once again notice how much slower the Owin hosting is when sending data.
