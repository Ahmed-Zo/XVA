##XVA-06-06 NetMF

### Installed Nuget Packages

- XSockets
- XSockets.JsApi
- XSockets.Client (NETMF 4.2)

To run this sample you need have .NET MicroFramework installed as well as the VSIX for VS2013. You can download the needed files from [netmf.codeplex.com](https://netmf.codeplex.com/downloads/get/911222)

### Description

Since you can connect anything that has  TCP/IP to XSockets it is pretty easy to hook up microcontrollers such as Arduino, Netduino etc.

In this sample we show how to talk full duplex between JavaScript and NETMF. Being able to call your hardware is just as important as being able to receive data from it. State and Cross-Protocol communication will save our day in this scenario.
