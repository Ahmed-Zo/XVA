##XVA-01-06 State RPC

### Installed Nuget Packages

- XSockets
- XSockets.JsApi
- Knockoutjs

### Description

State is very important when building modern real-time applications, regardless of web/native or other platforms.

In this "chat" we show how to take advantage of server side state to be able to perform scenarios that would have been complex without state. Such as targeting a subset of clients connected.

This example uses the RPC pattern, but we also provide the same example with publish/subscribe.
