### Description

WebRTC is much more than video/audio in the browser without plugins, but in this sample we only show the basics of how to create a multi-video chat.

If you look at the server-side code you can see that there is alot of functionality not used in this basic sample. For example there are support for

- Presence
- Voice messages
- Data channels
