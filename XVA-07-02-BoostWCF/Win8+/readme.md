##XVA-07-02 Boost WCF


### Installed Nuget Packages

- XSockets.Owin.Host
- XSockets.JsApi
- jQuery

### Description


In this sample we show a very simple way of boosting a WCF to realtime with a single line of code.
In this case we assume that all the stuff i located in the same project and therefor we can use the XSockets controller from the WCF.
The sample will be updated shortly and show how this can be done from any WCF using a XSockets "client pool".
